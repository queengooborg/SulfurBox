# SulfurBox
## WARNING: SULFURBOX IS STILL IN EARLY DEVELOPMENT AND IS NOT READY TO BE USED
Making Minecraft modding just a little easier.

SulfurBox is a command-line and graphics-interfaced program designed to generate Gradle buildscripts and modinfo files, as well as setup the decompiling workspace and configure the Eclipse/IDEA project, for Minecraft Forge mods.  One core component provided is the removal of the need to add another mod's maven repository yourself; simply call the mod by name and version, and let SulfurBox's database handle the rest.  Easily switch Minecraft and Forge versions, sync with your repositories, generate mcmod.info files, and deploy mods by defining a JSON-formatted config file manually or through the GUI, then clicking a button or running the command, and generate your files!
